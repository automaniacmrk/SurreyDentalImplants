Why compromise the structure of surrounding healthy teeth to bridge a space? A partial denture can also be removed at night, or even after meals. This could cause food to trap between teeth. When teeth are missing, the jawbone starts to deteriorate. However, dental implants stop the bone from melting away, providing a much more pleasing appearance and significant improvement in chewing function compared to an empty space.</p><p>Implants can be used for a single tooth or multiple missing teeth, as well as the whole dental arch. If conventional dentures are not fitting well due to lack of jawbone, an implant-supported denture can be ideal in returning proper retention and function of your dentures.</p><h2>How Does Dental Implant Restoration Work?</h2><p>Dental implants are an artificial tooth that looks natural and is made from metal or porcelain. The implant consists of two parts: a titanium screw attached to the jawbone, and a tooth-coloured Crown. Dental implants can be used to replace missing teeth and are biocompatible. They fuse well with bone.</p><p>Dental implants are not like dentures. They will stay in place and remain there. They do not interfere with speech. Implants are a permanent part of the mouth and can be used to alleviate pain. Furthermore, dental implants do not require the reduction of any of your remaining teeth. Implants look so much like natural teeth, that nobody will know you have had it unless they perform a dental examination.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://surreydentalimplants.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dental-implant-before-after-dental-surrey.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Surrey Dental Implants" data-cke-saved-src=" https://surreydentalimplants.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dental-implant-before-after-dental-surrey.png"></p><h2>Implant Surgery: Is it painful?</h2><p>Although the process may sound daunting, implant patients often find placement much better than anticipated. As with all dental treatments, you'll be conscious during the procedure and given local anesthesia. For more complex procedures, or at a patient's request, we can also provide conscious sedation, meaning a more comfortable experience for the patient.</p><p>The surgery should be painless and you will not feel any discomfort.</p><p>You will feel some discomfort after the procedure is completed. You will receive post-operative medication depending on what type of surgery you had and the specific needs of your health. This medication is designed to keep you pain-free as well as low-risk of infection.</p><p>Implants may cause some discomfort if bone grafts were performed alongside them. However, it is still minimal.</p><p>If you have any questions or worries before, during or after your treatment the team at Weybridge Dental Practice are happy to help you.</p><h2>What is the time it takes?</h2><ul><li>Examination</li></ul><ul><li>Examining</li></ul><p>You will be subject to a comprehensive oral exam during your appointment. We will require a 3D X-ray called a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scan. It provides precise information about the amount of bone available as well as its proximity to any other important structures, like nerves or blood vessels. We wait six to twelve weeks for teeth that need to be extracted before we place an implant. However, there are some cases when the crown can be placed immediately.</p><ul><li>Surgical Procedure</li></ul><ul><li>Surgical Procedure</li></ul><ul><li>Recovery</li></ul><ul><li>Recovery</li></ul><p>You may feel some discomfort after the anesthetic has worn off. You will be given specific instruction on what medication to take and how to look after the surgical site. The implant will begin to fuse and merge with the surrounding bone (osseo-integration). This process takes time depending on how well the patient heals and whether any bone grafting has been done. Integration can take as long as 3 months in simple cases, while it may take 9 months to integrate grafted cases.</p><ul><li>Installation of the crown</li></ul><ul><li>Fitting of the implant crown</li></ul><p>Once the implant has fused with the bone you will pay your dentist another visit, at this point, your dentist will take an impression to fabricate a custom made porcelain crown. At the following appointment, the crown is then either screwed or cemented to the implant body, completing the restoration.</p><p>At Weybridge dental practice we have the latest facilities including specialised equipment such as microscopes and hard/soft tissue lasers. We only use the finest implant components made by the most respected manufacturers around the globe. There are over 250 different implant manufacturers with thousands of different implant designs. Many attempt to copy the designs of more successful and established implant companies. Noess and Nobel Biocare are our market leaders.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 22, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/authors/dentist/" rel="author">Dentist</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/surrey-dental-implants.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Surrey Dental Implants</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/dental-implant-tooth-process.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Dental Implant Tooth Process </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:04" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/surrey-dental-implant-specialists.html">Surrey Dental Implant Specialists</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:02" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/what-is-a-dental-implant.html">What is a Dental Implant?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:02" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/dental-implant-tooth-process.html">Dental Implant Tooth Process</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Surrey Dental Implants</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/SurreyDentalImplants/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

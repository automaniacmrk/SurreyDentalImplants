Sometimes, the tooth may be damaged and still in its place. In these cases the dentist might need to extract it separately before proceeding with the implant process.</p><p>First, open the gum to reveal the bone. Each dental implant is then carefully placed in a socket that has been precisely drilled to the exact location of each tooth. After the implant site is inserted, the gum tissue around it is closed. The dental implant may be placed simultaneously with the removal of the tooth.</p><p>If a dental implant has a screw-thread on its outer surface it can be screwed into position and if it does not, it is usually tapped into place.</p><p>When installing a dental implant, the main goal is to make contact immediately with surrounding bone. This creates an initial stability, which over time is steadily enhanced by further growth of bone into microscopic grooves on the implant surface.</p><p>Dental implants are designed to hold replacement teeth. They usually have an internal screw thread, or post space. This allows for a wide range of parts to fit.</p><p>Once fitted, these components provide the foundation for long-term support of crowns, bridges or dentures.</p><h2>Dental Implant Tooth Process</h2><p>Dental implants are a long-lasting and safe way to replace your damaged or missing teeth. We'll help you decide if dental implants are right for you.</p><p>Dental implant procedures are just one of the many dental services we offer our patients.

As with all dental treatments, you'll be conscious during the procedure and given local anesthesia. For more complex procedures, or at a patient's request, we can also provide conscious sedation, meaning a more comfortable experience for the patient.</p><p>The surgery should be painless and you will not feel any discomfort.</p><p>After the surgery is carried out you will experience some discomfort as the anesthetic wears off. You will receive post-operative medication depending on what type of surgery you had and the specific needs of your health. This medication is designed to keep you pain-free as well as low-risk of infection.</p><p>If bone grafts are performed along with the implants there may be slightly more discomfort, but still only minor amounts.</p><p>If you have any questions or worries before, during or after your treatment the team at Angel Care Dental are happy to help you.</p><h2>What Is A Dental Implant?</h2><p>Dental implants are artificial screws made of titanium or zirconium oxide that connect the jawbone and a dental restoration like a crown or denture. They are also called 'endosseous' implants or fixtures. They are an artificial tooth root. Implants are a replacement for natural teeth. Dental surgeons perform bone grafting procedures to hold the implant in place for patients who do not have enough surrounding bone structure, or graft bone to help connect implants to the maxillary sinuses on either side of the nose when placing dental implants in the upper jaw.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="http://dentaltourismohrid.com/images/implantabroad.gif" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Surrey Dental Implants" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>How Does Dental Implant Restoration Work?</h2><p>Dental implants are an artificial tooth that looks natural and is made from metal or porcelain. The implant consists of two parts: a titanium screw attached to the jawbone, and a tooth-coloured Crown. Since dental implants are biocompatible and designed to fuse with bone, they offer a permanent solution that can last a lifetime with proper maintenance.</p><p>Dental implants are not like dentures. They will stay in place and remain there. So, they do not impede speech in any way. Implants are a permanent part of the mouth and can be used to alleviate pain. Furthermore, dental implants do not require the reduction of any of your remaining teeth. They so closely resemble natural teeth that no one will ever know you've had restoration unless they do a dental exam.</p><h2>What is the Lifespan of Dental Implants?</h2><p>Provided you take good care of your dental implants, they can last a lifetime. Look after them by maintaining good oral hygiene, brushing, flossing and having regular check-ups with your dentist.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://mydentistnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/dental-implants-surrey.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Surrey Dental Implants" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Why Do People Get Dental Implants?</h2><p>There are certainly advantages to replace missing teeth with dental implants. The bone shrinks from lack of chewing, which causes the tooth to fall out. Dental implants help prevent bone shrinkage because they bring the chewing power back. Dental implants also prevent neighbouring teeth from moving toward the missing tooth spot, which can have a domino effect on the spacing of your teeth.</p><p>Dental implants can also be a long-term option for dental care. Although they may cost more initially, long-term visits are usually less frequent with dental implants. Compared to bridges and crowns, implants wear down at a much slower rate.</p><h2>How Long Does It Take?</h2><ul><li>Examination</li></ul><ul><li>Examining</li></ul><p>You will be subject to a comprehensive oral exam during your appointment. We will require a 3D X-ray called a Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scan. It provides precise information about the amount of bone available as well as its proximity to any other important structures, like nerves or blood vessels. If teeth have to be removed, then we normally wait 6-12 weeks before placing the implant, although there are a few cases where we can place the crown immediately after the tooth has been removed.</p><ul><li>Operative Procedure</li></ul><ul><li>Operative Procedure</li></ul><ul><li>Recovery</li></ul><ul><li>Recovery</li></ul><p>You may feel some discomfort after the anesthetic has worn off. You will be given specific instruction on what medication to take and how to look after the surgical site. Implants will fuse with surrounding bone and become one (osseointegration). The time taken for this process to occur depends on the healing capabilities of the individual and if any bone grafting was carried out. Integration can take as long as 3 months in simple cases, while it may take 9 months to integrate grafted cases.</p><ul><li>Installation of the crown</li></ul><ul><li>Installation of the crown</li></ul><p>After the implant is fused to the bone, you'll need to visit your dentist again. At this time, the dentist will make an impression and fabricate a customized porcelain crown. The crown will be cemented or screwed to the implant, complete the restoration.</p><p>Angel Care Dental has the most up-to-date equipment, including microscopes and soft tissue lasers. We only use the finest implant components made by the most respected manufacturers around the globe. Over 250 implant companies offer thousands of implant designs. Many attempt to copy the designs of more successful and established implant companies. We partner with the market leaders who are Nobel Biocare and Noess.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://d2zp5xs5cp8zlg.cloudfront.net/image-30069-400.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Surrey Dental Implants" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Why Dental Implants?</h2><p>Implants are better than partial or bridge dentures. To bridge one space, why compromise the healthy structure of nearby teeth? In addition, removing a partial denture at night or after meals may be inconvenient and cause food trapping between other teeth. The jawbone begins to degrade when teeth become missing. Dental implants prevent the bone from separating, which gives the implant a more attractive appearance as well as a significant improvement in chewing ability.</p><p>Implants can be used for a single tooth or multiple missing teeth, as well as the whole dental arch. Implant-supported dentures can replace conventional dentures that aren't fitting properly due to a lack of jawbone.</p><h2>Who Is Suitable For Dental Implant Treatment?</h2><p>Adults of all ages are eligible for dental implants provided they are in good physical condition and their gums are healthy. We always carry out a thorough consultation first to determine if it is safe to go ahead with the treatment.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://thegentledental.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/implant-clinic-surrey.png" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Surrey Dental Implants" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Dental Implant Restoration</h2><p>If you are looking to have missing teeth replaced, you may want to consider our dental implant restoration services.</p><h2>What Are Dental Implants?</h2><p>Dental implant surgery is a procedure that replaces tooth roots with metal, screw like posts and replaces damaged or missing teeth with artificial teeth that look and function much like real ones.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-b6fNgnfrIs/maxresdefault.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Surrey Dental Implants" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>What Are The Alternatives To Dental Implants?</h2><p>A bridge: Like an implant, a bridge is a fixed option. Bridges use the space on either side of a gap to replace a missing tooth. They are not suitable for large spans and unfortunately require the preparation of healthy teeth to support the missing tooth. They also do not last as long as implants, on average 15 years. At this point it is likely the supporting teeth will also be compromised, resulting in an even larger gap.</p><h2>The Integration Period</h2><p>There is a waiting period of about 3 and 5 months for the implant and the bone to knit together. This is called the Integration period. During this time any gap that you have in your mouth will have a temporary bridge or a denture to fill the space if required.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://cuspdental.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/implant.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Surrey Dental Implants" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Benefits Of Dental Implants</h2><p>There are many expected (and unexpected) benefits of dental implants, including:</p><p>Even better, implants can be more comfortable and durable than traditional dentures.</p><h2>How Do I Prepare For My Dental Implant Procedure?</h2><p>To discuss your entire procedure, Angel Care Dental should conduct a thorough dental exam.

Make an appointment now.</p><h2>What Do Dental Implants Look Like?</h2><p>Dental implants will look exactly like your natural teeth. The dental implant is not visible as it is integrated into the jawbone. The prosthesis (crown) that attaches to the implant is made to match the look and function of your neighbouring teeth.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://surreydentalimplants.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/pav-khaira-dental-implants-surrey-415x498.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Surrey Dental Implants" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>More About Dental Implants</h2><p>Implants can do much more than fill gaps.
